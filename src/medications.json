    "description": "Zepbound (Tirzepatide) was FDA approved in November 2023 for managing obesity in conjunction withdiet and exercise. Zepbound contains the exact same medicine as Mounjaro, both produced by the USpharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Zepbound offers the same six dosages (2.5 mg, 5.0mg, 7.5mg, 10mg,12.5mg, 15 mg) as Mounjaro. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) is an improvement over Semaglutide(Wegovy, Ozempic, Rybelsus), as it binds to two receptors, GLP-1 and GIP, to suppress appetite andregulate insulin production. The medicine is administered weekly through self-injection. Clinical trialsthat evaluated the effectiveness of Tirzepatide on people with obesity demonstrated over 20% weightreduction, with a 230 lbs participant shedding an average of over 50 lbs over the course of the study(published in the New England Journal of Medicine). This substantial weight loss is comparable tobariatric surgery outcomes like Sleeve Gastrectomy and Gastric Bypass. Tirzepatide is recognized byscientists as a major breakthrough for managing obesity and diabetes. Common side effects of Zepbound(Tirzepatide) occur in the gastrointestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea). Prescribedby Dr. Yip since August 2022, Tirzepatide is well-tolerated based on his clinical experience. It isrecommended to start with 2.5mg weekly injections in the first month and progress to 5mg weekly inmonth 2 is tolerated.",

    "subtitle": "Weekly Injection",
    "description": "Mounjaro (tirzepatide) received FDA approval for managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in May 2022. It's important to note that Mounjaro is identical to Zepbound. The FDA mandates specific prescriptions based on the condition being treated: Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for obesity. This poses a challenge for physicians treating overweight patients with diabetes, requiring a decision between the two medications. Mounjaro is available in six dosages (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, and 15 mg) and is self-administered weekly using an auto-injector. It functions by binding to GLP-1 and GIP receptors to regulate insulin production and suppress appetite. Mounjaro has been well tolerated by most of my patients.",

    "description": "Phentermine was FDA approved for weight management in the 1960s and has been the “go-to” weight loss medicine for many years. Because there are many generic versions, phentermine is very cost-effective. Phentermine was part of a very popular “diet-combo pill” known as “phen-fen” (phentermine-fenfluramine) in the ’90s until it was discovered that fenfluramine was associated with heart valve problems and pulmonary hypertension. Although fenfluramine was withdrawn from the market in 1997, phentermine remains to be the most prescribed appetite suppressant in the United States since it is not known to cause heart valve issues.

    "subtitle": "Oral Medication",
    "description": "In late 1990s, Dr. Yip collaborated with psychiatrists to explore whether obesity is a consequence of “food addiction.” Clinical studies were conducted utilizing several anti-addiction medications for treatment of obesity. Although some of these anti-addiction medicines demonstrated weight loss effects, they all suffered from a similar psychiatric side effect: depression. For instance, rimonabant, an anti-marijuana (anti-cannabinoid) receptor blocker was approved in Europe in 2006 to treat overweight patients. However, rimonabant was withdrawn from the European market in 2008 because of its psychiatric side effects. Meanwhile, Contrave is a combination anti-addiction and antidepressant medication that was approved in 2014. It contains Naltrexone, which is currently used for opiate and alcohol addiction, combined with bupropion, an antidepressant. Clinical trials have shown that overweight individuals are able to lose approximately 10% of their body weight by taking Contrave. The most common side effect of Contrave is nausea. Contrave is still a brand name medication and costs approximately $100 per month. ",
