    "description": "Mounjaro (Tirzepatide) is the newest FDA approved medication for management of diabetes and obesity.  It was launched in July 2022.  Mounjaro (Tirzepatide) is an improvement over Semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic, Rybelsus).  It binds to two receptors scientifically known as GLP-1 and GIP to regulate insulin production from pancreas and suppress our appetite. It is a weekly injection that you do yourself.  Clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of Tirzepatide on people with obesity showed over 20% of weight reduction during the course of the study (published in New England Journal of Medicine (1).   A 230 lb participant lost an average of over 50 lbs in the study !!  This significant weight loss is comparable to those patients who have undergone bariatric surgery e.g. Sleeve gastrectomy. Tirzepatide is recognized by scientists as a major breakthrough in the management of patients with diabetes and obesity. The most common side effects of Mounjaro occur in the gastrointestinal tract (nausea, diarrhea, constipation and bloating in over 20% of participants).  From Dr. Yip’s clinical experience, they are well-tolerated.  There are six dosages of Mounjaro (2.5 mg; 5 mg; 7.5mg; 10mg; 12.5 mg and 15 mg).  It is recommended that all persons start with 2.5 mg weekly injection in the first month and move up to 5 mg weekly in month 2 as tolerated.",

    "description": "Phentermine was FDA approved for weight management in the 1960s.  It has been the “Go-to” medicine for many years.  Because there are many generic versions, Phentermine is cost-effective and not expensive.  Phentermine is part of a very popular “Diet-combo pill” known as “Phen-fen” (phentermine-fenfluramine) in the 90’s.   It was discovered that fenfluramine was associated with heart valve problems and pulmonary hypertension.  Fenfluramine was withdrawn from the market in 1997.  Phentermine was not known to cause heart valve issues and remained to be the most prescribed appetite suppressant in the United States.  ",

    "subtitle": "Oral Medication",
    "description": "In late 1990’s; in collaboration with psychiatrists; Dr. Yip was exploring whether obesity is in fact a consequence of “Food addiction.”  Clinical studies were conducted utilizing several Anti-addiction medications for treatment of obesity.  Although some of these anti-addiction medicines have demonstrated weight loss effects, they all suffered from a similar psychiatric side effect which was depression.  Rimonabant, an anti-marijuana (anti-cannabinoid) receptor blocker was actually approved in Europe in 2006 to treat overweight persons.  But Rimonabant was withdrawn from the European market in 2008 because of its psychiatric (depression) side effects.  Contrave was approved in 2014.   It contains Naltrexone, which is currently used for opiate; alcohol addiction and it combines with Bupropion which is an Anti-depressant.  Clinical trials have shown that overweight individuals are able to lose approximately 10% of their body weight by taking Contrave.  The Most common side effect of Contrave is Nausea.  Contrave is still a brand name medication and costs approximately $100 per month.",
